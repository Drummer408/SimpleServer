# SimpleServer

## Introduction
A small scale web server that performs basic mathematical computations. The purpose of this project is to expand upon core network programming skills and experiment with multi-threaded client/server applications. This project is completed without the use of third party networking libraries in order to gain a deeper insight on what exactly is happening "behind the scenes"

The functions provided by this web server are:
* add
* subtract
* multiply
* divide

## Syntax
In order to run the client, you must first make sure the server is running. Once everything is running appropriately, the client will display a prompt similar to that of a unix shell --> "$ ". When you see this prompt, this means that the system is waiting for you to enter data. Proper syntax is as follows:

```
<math_function> <argument_1> <argument_2> ... <argument_n>
```
